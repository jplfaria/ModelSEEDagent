=== TIMEOUT FIX COMPREHENSIVE TEST REPORT ===
Generated: 2025-06-07 22:03:10

Tests Performed:
1. ✅ ArgoLLM timeout configuration validation
2. ✅ Agent timeout detection logic
3. ✅ Manual timeout logic validation
4. ✅ Signal timeout mechanism testing

Key Findings:
- o1 models (gpto1, gpto1mini, etc.) correctly use 120s timeouts
- Standard models (gpt4o, etc.) correctly use 30s timeouts
- Signal-based timeout mechanism is functional
- Debug logging provides comprehensive timeout information

Expected Behavior:
- When using gpto1 model, you should see "Using 120s timeout" in logs
- When using gpt4o model, you should see "Using 30s timeout" in logs
- No more "timed out (30s)" warnings for o1 models
- Comprehensive debug logs showing timeout detection

Next Steps:
1. Test with actual interactive CLI: `modelseed-agent interactive`
2. Monitor logs for timeout debug messages
3. Verify no 30s timeout warnings for o1 models
4. Confirm improved performance with longer timeouts
