- Automatic FastAPI router generation from schemas
- Provenance tracking with SHA-256 model/data hashing
- Standardized ToolResult format across all tools

### Async Job Management
- Long-running operations (gapfilling, large builds) use async job nodes
- Job submission → polling → result collection pattern
- LangGraph StateGraph persistence for job recovery

### Open-Source Solver Strategy
- HiGHS → GLPK → CBC fallback hierarchy
- No dependency on commercial solvers (Gurobi/CPLEX)
- Automatic solver detection and error handling

### Universal ID Resolution
- SQLite biochem.db with ModelSEED + BiGG + KEGG mappings
- resolve_biochem_entity and search_biochem tools
- All tool outputs enriched with human-readable names
