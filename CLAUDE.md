## Detailed Implementation Roadmap

### Core Library Versions (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Exact versions for reproducibility
pip install cobra>=0.26
pip install git+https://github.com/ModelSEEDpy/ModelSEEDpy@dev
pip install git+https://github.com/Fxe/cobrakbase@cobra-model
```

### Phase 1: ✅ ModelSEEDpy Tool Integration [COMPLETE]

**Accomplishments**:
- ✅ RastAnnotationTool: `annotate_genome_rast` with BV-BRC integration
- ✅ ModelBuildTool: `build_metabolic_model` with MSBuilder + templates
- ✅ GapFillTool: `gapfill_model` with MSGapfill algorithms

build_result = build_tool.run({"genome_object": annotation_result.data["genome_object"]})
gapfill_result = gapfill_tool.run({"model_object": build_result.data["model_object"]})
```

### Phase 1A: ✅ COBRApy Enhancement [COMPLETE]

**Problem Identified**: Current COBRApy tools only used ~15-20% of COBRApy's capabilities
**Solution Implemented**: Added 5 critical missing COBRApy tools

**Accomplishments**:
- ✅ **FluxVariabilityTool**: Min/max flux ranges analysis with categorization of fixed/variable/blocked reactions
- ✅ **GeneDeletionTool**: Single/double gene knockout analysis with essentiality classification
- ✅ **EssentialityAnalysisTool**: Comprehensive essential gene/reaction identification with functional categorization
- ✅ **FluxSamplingTool**: Statistical flux space exploration with correlation analysis and subsystem breakdown
- ✅ **ProductionEnvelopeTool**: Growth vs production trade-off analysis for metabolic engineering

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# All tools implemented following existing patterns
✅ src/tools/cobra/flux_variability.py - FVA with advanced result categorization
✅ src/tools/cobra/gene_deletion.py - Gene knockout with growth impact analysis
✅ src/tools/cobra/essentiality.py - Essential component identification
✅ src/tools/cobra/flux_sampling.py - Statistical sampling with correlation analysis
✅ src/tools/cobra/production_envelope.py - Metabolic engineering analysis
✅ CLI integration updated - all tools available in setup command
✅ __init__.py exports updated - proper tool registration
```

**Impact Achieved**: Tool count expanded from 6 → 11 total tools (3 basic + 5 advanced COBRA + 3 ModelSEED)
**COBRApy Coverage**: Increased from ~15% → ~60% of COBRApy capabilities
**Verification**: Core functionality tested and confirmed working with e_coli_core.xml

### Phase 2: 🚧 cobrakbase Compatibility Layer

**Goal**: Ensure ModelSEED-generated models are fully compatible with COBRApy workflows

**Refined Scope**:
- SBML round-trip compatibility verification (not KBase JSON integration)
- Cross-compatibility testing between ModelSEED tools and COBRA tools
- Harmonized model formats and standards

**Implementation Tasks**:
```bash
# Add cobrakbase compatibility layer
create src/tools/compatibility/ with verification functions

# Test ModelSEED → COBRApy compatibility
verify that models built with ModelSEEDpy work seamlessly with existing COBRA tools

# Add cross-compatibility tests
ensure growth rates and flux distributions are identical (±1e-6) between formats
```

### Phase 3: 📋 Biochemistry Database Enhancement

**Goal**: Universal ID resolution system for enhanced biochemistry reasoning

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Build unified biochemistry database
create scripts/build_biochem_db.py merging ModelSEED + BiGG + KEGG mappings → SQLite

# Add resolution tools
implement resolve_biochem_entity and search_biochem tools

# Enhance existing tool outputs
modify all tools to include reaction names, compound names, and equations
```

**Expected Capabilities**:
- Agent can reason about "Phosphoglycerate mutase" instead of "rxn10271"
- All outputs include human-readable biochemistry information
- Universal ID translation between ModelSEED, BiGG, and KEGG namespaces

### Phase 4+: Advanced Library Ecosystem

**Post-Core Enhancement Libraries** (implement after Phases 1-3 complete):

#### Phase 4A: Strain Design & Engineering
- **Cameo**: Metabolic engineering optimization (OptKnock, pathway design)
- **StrainDesign**: MILP-based strain optimization (growth-coupled designs, minimal cut sets)

#### Phase 4B: Community & Multi-Organism Modeling
- **MICOM**: Microbial community modeling with cross-feeding analysis

#### Phase 4C: Thermodynamics & Constraints
- **pyTFA**: Thermodynamics-based flux analysis with ΔG constraints
- **MultiTFA**: Advanced thermodynamic analysis with uncertainty quantification

#### Phase 4D: Multi-Omics Integration
- **GECKOpy**: Enzyme-constrained modeling with proteomics integration
- **RIPTiDe**: Transcriptomics-guided context-specific modeling

#### Phase 4E: Dynamic & Kinetic Modeling
- **MASSpy**: Kinetic modeling and dynamic simulation (time-course FBA)
- **COBRAme**: Metabolism-Expression models (gene expression burden)

**Integration Pattern**: Each library becomes a mini-phase with:
1. Wrapper tool following BaseTool pattern
2. Small demo dataset in `data/examples/`
3. Pytest validation of core functionality
4. FastAPI auto-exposure via schema registry

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Schema-First Tool Design
- All tools use Pydantic InputSchema/OutputSchema
- Automatic FastAPI router generation from schemas
- Provenance tracking with SHA-256 model/data hashing
- Standardized ToolResult format across all tools

### Async Job Management
- Long-running operations (gapfilling, large builds) use async job nodes
- Job submission → polling → result collection pattern
- LangGraph StateGraph persistence for job recovery

### Open-Source Solver Strategy
- HiGHS → GLPK → CBC fallback hierarchy
- No dependency on commercial solvers (Gurobi/CPLEX)
- Automatic solver detection and error handling

### Universal ID Resolution
- SQLite biochem.db with ModelSEED + BiGG + KEGG mappings
- resolve_biochem_entity and search_biochem tools
- All tool outputs enriched with human-readable names

## Current Task Status & Autonomous Progression Plan

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update this CLAUDE.md with ✅ completion status
   - Update relevant docs/ files with new capabilities
   - Add example usage in docs/notebooks/
3. **Commit to Dev Branch**:
   - Clear commit message: "feat: Phase X complete - [brief description]"
   - Include CHANGELOG.md entry
   - Tag with version bump
4. **Verify Integration**: Test CLI shows new tools, agent can use new capabilities
5. **Proceed to Next Phase**: Begin next priority task without waiting for input

### Quality Gates (Must Pass for Autonomous Progression):
- All pytest tests pass (100% success rate)
- No performance regressions (existing workflows same speed ±10%)
- CLI integration functional (new tools appear in setup command)
- Documentation updated and consistent
- Existing user workflows preserved exactly

growth_rate = FBATool().run({'model_object': model}).data['growth_rate']
assert growth_rate > 1e-6  # Model should grow
"
