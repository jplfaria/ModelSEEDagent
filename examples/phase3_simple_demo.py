Essential gene analysis using single gene deletion reveals 312 genes critical for growth, representing 14.2% of the genome, which aligns with established literature values from Reed et al. (2003) and Feist et al. (2007). The high growth rate indicates efficient glucose utilization through glycolysis (8.2 mmol/gDW/h) and TCA cycle (4.1 mmol/gDW/h) with balanced ATP/NADH production. Media composition analysis confirms adequate concentrations of all essential nutrients including nitrogen (NH3), phosphorus (PO4), sulfur (SO4), and trace elements (Mg2+, Fe2+). Cross-validation with experimental data demonstrates 92% agreement, providing high confidence in these predictions. The organism exhibits metabolic flexibility with alternative pathway activation under constraint conditions.""",
