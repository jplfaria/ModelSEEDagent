Intelligent Metabolic Analysis Script

This script demonstrates TRUE intelligent agent behavior where the agent:
1. Reasons about what information it needs based on the question
2. Dynamically chooses appropriate tools
3. Analyzes results and decides what to do next
4. Continues until it has sufficient information to answer

No explicit tool instructions - just natural questions!
