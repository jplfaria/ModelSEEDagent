## 🔗 Multi-Step Reasoning Chains

### What They Are
Instead of running single tools, AI now plans sophisticated multi-step analysis workflows where each step builds on previous discoveries.

### Example: Comprehensive E. coli Analysis

**Traditional Approach:**
```
User: "Analyze this E. coli model"
→ Single tool execution
→ Basic result
```

**Phase 8 Reasoning Chain:**
```
🧠 AI Planning: "User wants comprehensive analysis"
   → Step 1: run_metabolic_fba (baseline growth assessment)

🔧 Step 1 Result: Growth rate = 0.82 h⁻¹ (high growth detected)
   → AI Decision: "High growth suggests complex nutrition needs"
   → Step 2: find_minimal_media (nutritional analysis)

🔧 Step 2 Result: 14 essential nutrients required
   → AI Decision: "Complex nutrition confirmed, check robustness"
   → Step 3: analyze_essentiality (essential components)

🧬 Final AI Synthesis: "Robust metabolism (0.82 h⁻¹) with moderate
   nutritional complexity (14 nutrients) and 12 essential genes"
```

### Interactive Chain Builder

The reasoning chain builder helps you create sophisticated workflows:

1. **Query Input**: Describe your analysis goal
2. **Tool Selection**: Choose from available metabolic tools
3. **Reasoning Capture**: Explain why each tool is needed
4. **Confidence Tracking**: Set confidence levels for each step
5. **Chain Execution**: Watch AI execute your planned workflow

### Quick Templates

Pre-built chains for common analyses:

- **Comprehensive**: Complete model characterization
- **Growth Optimization**: Maximize growth potential
- **Nutrition Analysis**: Detailed nutritional requirements
- **Robustness Testing**: Model stability analysis

---

## 🔬 Hypothesis-Driven Analysis

### Scientific Reasoning

AI now thinks like a scientist, generating testable hypotheses about metabolic behavior and systematically evaluating them.

### Example Workflow

**Observation:** "Model shows low growth rate (0.05 h⁻¹)"

**AI Hypothesis Generation:**
1. **H1**: "Nutritional limitations constrain growth" (confidence: 85%)
2. **H2**: "Essential gene knockouts affect biomass" (confidence: 72%)
3. **H3**: "Pathway bottlenecks limit flux" (confidence: 68%)

**Systematic Testing:**
```
🧪 Testing H1: Nutritional limitations
   → find_minimal_media: 20 nutrients required ✅ SUPPORTS H1
   → identify_auxotrophies: 5 auxotrophies found ✅ SUPPORTS H1

📊 Evidence Evaluation:
   H1 STRONGLY SUPPORTED (evidence strength: 0.92)

🎯 Conclusion: "Growth limitation confirmed - model requires 20 nutrients
   with 5 essential auxotrophies for optimal performance"
```

### Hypothesis Types

- **Nutritional Gap**: Missing nutrients or biosynthetic capabilities
- **Gene Essentiality**: Essential genes affecting growth
- **Pathway Activity**: Alternative metabolic strategies
- **Metabolic Efficiency**: Optimization opportunities
- **Biomass Composition**: Biomass synthesis issues
- **Regulatory Constraint**: Regulatory limitations

### Interactive Wizard

The hypothesis wizard guides you through:

1. **Observation Input**: Describe what you've noticed
2. **Hypothesis Suggestions**: AI suggests relevant hypotheses
3. **Custom Hypotheses**: Create your own testable statements
4. **Test Planning**: Select appropriate tools for testing
5. **Evidence Collection**: Systematic hypothesis evaluation

## 🤝 Collaborative Reasoning

### AI-Human Partnership

AI recognizes its limitations and requests human expertise when needed, creating a true partnership for complex decisions.

### When AI Requests Collaboration

- **High Uncertainty**: Multiple valid approaches available
- **Domain Expertise Needed**: Specialized biological knowledge required
- **Resource Trade-offs**: Optimization decisions with multiple criteria
- **Ambiguous Results**: Conflicting tool outputs need interpretation

### Example Collaboration

```
🤖 AI Analysis: "FBA shows growth rate of 0.8 h⁻¹, but flux variability
   analysis reveals multiple optimal solutions. Experimental validation
   strategy unclear."

🤝 AI Request: "I need your guidance on optimization strategy:"

   Option 1: Maximize Growth
   • AI Assessment: "Highest theoretical yield but may be unstable"
   • Trade-offs: High performance, experimental risk

   Option 2: Maximize Robustness
   • AI Assessment: "Lower yield but more experimentally reliable"
   • Trade-offs: Stable results, moderate performance

   Option 3: Balanced Approach
   • AI Assessment: "Moderate performance with good reliability"
   • Trade-offs: Balanced risk-reward profile

👤 Your Input: Strategy selection + rationale
🎯 Collaborative Decision: Combined AI analysis + human expertise
```

### Collaboration Types

- **Uncertainty**: AI is unsure about next steps
- **Choice**: Multiple valid options need prioritization
- **Expertise**: Domain knowledge required
- **Validation**: Confirm AI reasoning
- **Refinement**: Improve hypothesis or approach
- **Prioritization**: Resource allocation decisions

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Slow Reasoning Performance:**
```python
# Enable performance optimization
optimizer = PerformanceOptimizer(config)
agent = optimizer.create_optimized_agent(BaseAgent, config)

# Check cache hit rates
if optimizer.reasoning_cache.stats()['hit_rate'] < 0.5:
    print("Consider increasing cache size or TTL")
```

**Hypothesis Not Supported:**
```python
# Review evidence strength
if evidence_strength < 0.6:
    # Generate additional hypotheses
    alternative_hypotheses = generator.generate_alternative_hypotheses(
        observation, context
    )
```

**AI Requests Too Much Collaboration:**
```python
# Adjust collaboration threshold
collaborative_reasoner.uncertainty_threshold = 0.7  # Higher = less collaboration
collaborative_reasoner.confidence_threshold = 0.8   # Higher = more autonomous
```

### Getting Help
