# üìÅ Documentation Archive

This directory contains outdated documentation files that have been archived because they contained inaccurate information compared to the actual current state of the repository.

## üì¶ **Archived Files**

### `REPOSITORY_STATUS.md` (Moved from root)
- **Reason**: Claimed "PRODUCTION READY" status with "43/47 tests passing"
- **Reality**: Actually 40/47 tests passing, main CLI has import issues
- **Status**: Superseded by `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

### `REPOSITORY_REVIEW_AND_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` (Moved from docs/)
- **Reason**: Complex multi-phase plan that was partially implemented
- **Reality**: Many claimed completions were not actually done
- **Status**: Superseded by `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`

### `REPOSITORY_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` (Moved from docs/)
- **Reason**: Cleanup plan that was mostly completed but contained outdated references
- **Reality**: Cleanup was done but tracking was inaccurate
