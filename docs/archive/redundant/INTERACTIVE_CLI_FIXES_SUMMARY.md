# Interactive CLI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Configuration Loading Issue
**Problem**: Interactive CLI was hardcoded to use "gpt-4o-mini" instead of loading saved configuration.

**Solution**: Modified `conversation_engine.py` to load saved CLI configuration from `~/.modelseed-agent-cli.json`.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/interactive/conversation_engine.py`: Added `_load_cli_config()` method to read saved configuration

### 2. Tool Input Preparation Issues
**Problem**: Tools were receiving dict objects instead of string paths, causing "expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not dict" errors.

**Solution**: Enhanced `_prepare_tool_input()` method to ensure model paths are always strings.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/agents/real_time_metabolic.py`: Fixed tool input preparation with proper string conversion
- `src/agents/langgraph_metabolic.py`: Applied same fix for consistency

### 3. Inappropriate Tool Selection
**Problem**: AI was selecting ModelSEED build tools (like `build_metabolic_model`) for analysis queries, causing genome requirement errors.

**Solution**: Improved AI prompts with tool categorization and explicit guidelines.

**Files Changed**:
- `src/agents/real_time_metabolic.py`:
  - Enhanced `_ai_analyze_query_for_first_tool()` with categorized tool lists and clear guidelines
  - Enhanced `_ai_analyze_results_and_decide_next_step()` with same improvements
  - Added fallback error handling for ModelSEED tools

## Key Improvements

### 1. Tool Categorization
Tools are now categorized in AI prompts:
- **Analysis Tools**: For analyzing existing models (FBA, minimal media, essentiality, etc.)
- **Build Tools**: For creating new models from genome data (build_metabolic_model, etc.)
- **Biochemistry Tools**: For database queries (search_biochem, etc.)

### 2. Clear AI Guidelines
AI prompts now include explicit instructions:
- Use ANALYSIS TOOLS for model analysis queries
- Use BUILD TOOLS only when explicitly building new models from genome data
- FBA is usually the best starting point for E. coli analysis
- Build tools require genome annotation files

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Added graceful fallback for inappropriate tool selections:
- ModelSEED tools return error input when selected inappropriately
- Clear error messages guide users toward correct usage

### 4. Configuration Persistence
Interactive CLI now properly loads saved configuration:
- Reads LLM backend and model settings from persistent storage
- Uses saved timeouts and parameters for o1 models
- Maintains user preferences across sessions

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created
- `test_improved_tool_selection.py`: Verifies AI selects appropriate tools for different query types

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test improved tool selection
python test_improved_tool_selection.py

# Test interactive CLI with saved config
modelseed-agent interactive
```

## Expected Behavior

### Analysis Queries
Queries like "comprehensive metabolic analysis of E. coli" should now:
1. Select analysis tools (FBA, minimal media, essentiality)
2. Use existing model files correctly
3. Execute multiple complementary analyses
4. Provide comprehensive results without errors

### Build Queries
Queries like "build a model from genome file" should:
1. Select build tools (build_metabolic_model)
2. Request genome annotation files
3. Guide users through model building process

## Files Modified

1. `src/agents/real_time_metabolic.py`
   - Improved AI tool selection prompts
   - Enhanced tool input preparation
   - Added error handling for ModelSEED tools

2. `src/interactive/conversation_engine.py`
   - Added configuration loading from persistent storage
   - Enhanced agent initialization with saved settings

3. `src/agents/langgraph_metabolic.py`
   - Applied tool input preparation fixes

## Next Steps

1. Test the interactive CLI with various query types
2. Verify tool selection works correctly for both analysis and build scenarios
3. Ensure timeout fixes work properly with o1 models
4. Document best practices for users

## Usage Notes

- The interactive CLI now respects saved configuration from `modelseed-agent setup`
- Tool selection is much more intelligent and context-aware
- Error messages are clearer when inappropriate tools are selected
- The system gracefully handles both analysis and build scenarios
