## Autonomous Progression Protocol

### After Each Phase Completion:
1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Ensure no regressions (`pytest tests/ -v --cov=src`)
2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update this CLAUDE.md with ‚úÖ completion status
   - Update relevant docs/ files with new capabilities
   - Add example usage in docs/notebooks/
3. **Commit to Dev Branch**:
   - Clear commit message: "feat: Phase X complete - [brief description]"
   - Include CHANGELOG.md entry
   - Tag with version bump
4. **Verify Integration**: Test CLI shows new tools, agent can use new capabilities
5. **Proceed to Next Phase**: Begin next priority task without waiting for input

### Quality Gates (Must Pass for Autonomous Progression):
- All pytest tests pass (100% success rate)
- No performance regressions (existing workflows same speed ¬±10%)
- CLI integration functional (new tools appear in setup command)
- Documentation updated and consistent
- Existing user workflows preserved exactly

## Example Data & Testing

### Reference Datasets (Located in `/data/examples/`)
```bash
data/examples/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e_coli_core.xml                  # BiGG core model (620 kB) - primary test model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pputida.fna                      # P. putida KT2440 genome (4 MB) - build test
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GramNegModelTemplateV5.json      # ModelSEED template (1.3 MB) - build template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcriptome.tsv                # RNA-seq demo for RIPTiDe integration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ proteomics.csv                   # Proteome demo for GECKOpy integration
```

### Testing Strategy
```bash
# Phase 2 verification (cobrakbase compatibility)
python -c "
from src.tools.modelseed import ModelBuildTool
from src.tools.cobra import FBATool
import cobrakbase

# Build model with ModelSEED
result = build_tool.run({'fasta': 'data/examples/pputida.fna'})
model_path = result.data['model_path']

# Load with cobrakbase and test compatibility
model = cobrakbase.load_model(model_path)
growth_rate = FBATool().run({'model_object': model}).data['growth_rate']
assert growth_rate > 1e-6  # Model should grow
"

# Phase 3 verification (biochem resolution)
curl -X POST /tools/biochem/resolve_biochem_entity \
     -d '{"id":"rxn00001"}' | jq '.data.name'
# Expected: "Pyruvate kinase"
```
