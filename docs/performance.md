# Performance Optimizations

## Performance Optimizations

ModelSEEDagent includes several performance optimizations to improve analysis speed and reduce resource usage.

### Connection Pooling

HTTP connection pooling has been implemented to reduce the overhead of creating new connections for each LLM request:

- **Benefit**: Eliminates 40+ redundant ArgoLLM initializations per session
- **Implementation**: Session-level HTTP client reuse via `LLMConnectionPool`
- **Configuration**: Automatic - no user configuration required

#### Model Caching

Intelligent COBRA model caching reduces file I/O overhead and improves performance.

#### How It Works

**File Modification Tracking**:
- Models are cached with file modification timestamps
- Cache is invalidated when source files change
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory bloat

**Cache Benefits**:
- **4.7x speedup** for repeated model access
- Eliminates redundant SBML parsing
- Reduces disk I/O during analysis workflows

#### Cache Configuration

**Automatic Management**:
- Cache size is automatically managed
- LRU eviction for memory efficiency
- Debug logging shows cache hit/miss rates

**Cache Statistics** (in debug logs):
```
Loading model from disk: /path/to/model.xml
Using cached model: /path/to/model.xml
Cached model: /path/to/model.xml (ID: model_id)
```

#### Memory Usage

**Cache Efficiency**:
- Models are deep-copied when retrieved
- Original cached models remain unmodified
- Memory usage scales with model complexity

*No user configuration required - caching is automatic and transparent.*

COBRA tools now default to single-process mode to prevent connection pool fragmentation:

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `COBRA_DISABLE_MULTIPROCESSING=1` - Force single process mode
  - `COBRA_PROCESSES=N` - Set process count for all COBRA tools
  - `COBRA_FVA_PROCESSES=N` - Set process count for flux variability analysis
  - `COBRA_SAMPLING_PROCESSES=N` - Set process count for flux sampling

### Performance Monitoring

Built-in performance monitoring tracks optimization effectiveness:

- **Session metrics**: Total runtime, tool execution times
- **Connection tracking**: LLM initialization counts
- **Model access patterns**: Cache hit rates and load times
